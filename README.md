# Guess-That-Pokemon

____________________

This is a guessing game where players try to identify Pokémon by the outline of it. Built with React, it challenges players with limited lives to guess correctly before the Pokémon is revealed.

______________

_How the game Works:_

* You're shown a outline of a Pokémon.

* Type your guess into the input field and submit.

* You have 3 attempts per Pokémon.

* If correct, the full image is revealed and you can move to the next Pokémon.

* If you run out of guesses or reach the end, you can start a new game.
